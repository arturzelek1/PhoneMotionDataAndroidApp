# 📱 PhoneMotionDataAndroidApp

**PhoneMotionDataAndroidApp** is a native Android application developed to collect and log motion sensor data from mobile devices. It leverages the phone's built-in sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) to gather real-time movement data and send it to a server. The app was developed and used as part of my engineering thesis, which focused on a game utilizing real-time player movement. It demonstrates my understanding of Android development, hardware sensors, real-time data collection, server communication. The project can be applied to fitness tracking, motion analysis, data science, or machine learning projects related to human movement.
